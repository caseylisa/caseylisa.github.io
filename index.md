<h1> Project Background </h1>
<p>
Network Rail is the owner and infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales.
 
Our engagement with Network Rail began in 2014 when we were still Feedhenry and yet to be acquired by Redhat. Over time we have developed around 20 apps for use by their engineers, customers and business. We have also been involved in migration and conversion projects.
 
We deal with their MBS (Mobile Business Services) team *Rebranded as Digital Factory Oct 2019*. They engage with different “business” departments within Network Rail that require an app to be developed.
 
Initially projects were developed following waterfall methods but we have transitioned to an Agile approach.
